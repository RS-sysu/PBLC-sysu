GLM_PBL_b works pretty well!

ANN_PBL_b: 
	- if the true value of c is provided, it works pretty well
	- if c is estimated during optimization, c is probably overestimated and Pr(y = 1 | x) is underestimated
	- adding a constraint to force that the maximum prediction of Pr(y = 1 | x) equals 1 can estimate of c more reliable and accurate 
		- max_pr_y1 = 1.0	
		- lamda2 * tf.nn.l2_loss(tf.subtract(tf.reduce_max(prediction), max_pr_y1))
