# PBLC-sysu 
One classification is a common situation in the realistic context.  However, most methods focus on  binary classification to solve practical problems，which is not appropriate and efficient. Therefore, we propose Positive and unlabeled Background learning with Constraint as a BackBone for overcoming data shortcomings that misses reliable negative samples. Extensive experimental evaluations are conducted in the field of point cloud 、disaster monitoring、remote sensing and species distribution to verify the proposed method. The reaults show PBLC outperforms high accuracy and alleviate data defect。
