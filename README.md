# PBLC-sysu 
One classification is a common situation in computer version for overcome data shortcomings that contains labeled positive and unlabeled background data. However, most methods focus on  binary classification to solve practical problems，which is not appropriate and efficient. Therefor, we propose Positive and unlabeled Background learning with Constraint as a BackBone. Extensive experimental evaluations are conducted in the field of point cloud、disaster monitoring、remote sensing and species distribution to verify the proposed method. The reaults show PBLC outperforms high accuracy and alleviate data defect。
